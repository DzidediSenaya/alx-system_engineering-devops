- **Actions Taken:**
  - We investigated the monitoring system alert and initially suspected a potential attack.
  - Logs were reviewed to identify any anomalies.

- **Misleading Investigation:**
  - Initial suspicions of an attack led to deploying preventive measures unnecessarily.

  - The service was restored to normal operation.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

To keep our web service wide awake and prevent future mishaps:

- Implement stricter change management procedures for firewall rule modifications.
Let's ensure the service doesn't develop a taste for unauthorized changes.
- Develop automated testing and validation of firewall rules.
We'll catch those misconfigurations before they can brew trouble.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to provide earlier visibility into issues.
No more surprise coffee breaks!
- Provide additional training and awareness to the team about the importance of double-checking configurations.
We'll keep everyone wide awake, not in line for lattes.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify areas for improvement in incident response.
Let's stay wide awake for future challenges.
